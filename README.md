# Best-MTG-Deck

[Magic: The Gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering), (MTG) is a highly popular trading card game. Since competitive decks used in tournaments are usually expensive stock lists of cards (â‚¬ 150 upwards) that change once every 3-12 months, players need to know how much they need to spend to purchase a competitive deck, considering the cards already in their collection. Best-MTG-Deck is a user-friendly solution to this need: you only need to insert your collection of MTG cards (e.g.: 4 Tarmogoyf) to obtain a lot of useful information.

Best-MTG-Deck is a Flask web app that takes a list of cards as an input and shows how much you should spend to build every MTG Tier deck.
